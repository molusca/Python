Minigames created during basic Python learning.

### Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯
- The game will choose a random integer number between 0 and 100 and your task is to guess it
- The game difficulty defines the number of attempts:

    |Difficulty|Attempts|
    |---|---|
    |Easy | 10| 
    |Medium | 6|
    |Hard | 3|

- The player starts with 1000 points. Incorrect guesses takes away the difference between the incorect guess number and the correct secret number
- By the end of the game, the player will know his score

### Hangman ðŸ˜µ
- The game will choose randomly one of the 10 secret words in `hangman_dictionary.txt` (you can change them locally if you want). Your task is to find the complete word!
- Give only **single letters** or **complete words** as a guess, the game won't consider partial guesses
- The game ends when the player finds and types the complete word or makes 5 mistakes

#### Requirements:
- Python (version 3 or higher releases). [Click here to download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
