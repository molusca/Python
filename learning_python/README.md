I've created these simple programs when I was learning Python Basics. **They are really simple** but some of them are very usefull and nice if you are learning too. I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve, simplify, or make the code better. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to [email me](mailto:pro.lucasrfreitas@gmail.com)

#### Requirements:
- Any Python 3 or greater release
- A Python compiler

#### Programs:
- [quadratic_equation.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/quadratic_equation.py) - The user inputs a, b and c values of any quadratic function. The program calculates Delta, its square root and both function roots (x', x'') **Important: it doesn't returns fraction values, float only.**

- [brl_to_usd_converter.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/brl_to_usd_converter.py) - Consumes an API to get the actual Dollar price and tells the user how many dollars his *Reais* value are worth

- [mother_of_all_means.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/mother_of_all_means.py) - This program calculates the Geometric, Weighted, Harmonic or Arithmetic mean of how many values you want!

- [is_this_triangle_possible.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/is_this_triangle_possible.py) - Gets 3 lenght values and tells if it's possible to make a triangle with them. If so, tells what kind of triangle can be made with the values.

- [palindrome_verifier.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/palindrome_verifier.py) - Recieves an user string input and checks if it's a palindrome. [ [What is a palindrome?] ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)

- [prime_number.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/prime_number.py) - Tells if the input number is a prime number and show its dividers.

- [arithmetic_progression.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/arithmetic_progression.py) - Gets the first term, common difference and n-th term of an Arithmetic Progression; returns all elements in range, respecting the common difference.

- [math_test.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/math_test.py) - It's a math test for kids that are learning how to add integers. The program generates 5 random sums, recieves each answer, counts the correct ones and shows a message at the end.

- [product_discount.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/product_discount.py) - Calculates a new product price based on current value and discount percentage.

- [pay_raise_calculator.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/pay_raise_calculator.py) - Calculates a new pay value based on current value and raise percentage.

- [rental_calculator.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/rental_calculator.py) - Calculates a vehicle rental price based on number of days rent and mileage drove.

- [area_calculator.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/area_calculator.py) - Calculates area based on a height and width input.

- [speed_radar.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/speed_radar.py) - Calculates a speed fine price based on how much above the speed limit the driver was trafficking.

- [thermal_converter.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/thermal_converter.py) - Converts a Celsius value into Farenheit and Kelvin.

- [meters_converter.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/meters_converter.py) - Converts a meter value to centimeter and milimeter

- [people_research.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/people_research.py) - Reads 5 names, ages and sex. After that, the program shows the average age of the group, name and age of the older man, how many woman are under 20.

- [digit_separator.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/digit_separator.py) - The program separates a number input by ones, tenths, hundredths and thousandths.

- [multiplication_table.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/multiplication_table.py) - Thats all. A multiplication table using *for loops*.

- [name_analiser.py](https://github.com/molusca/Python/blob/master/learning_python/name_analiser.py) - Recieves user string input, return its length and manipulates it's visual.
